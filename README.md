# Software Licenses Manager

Just an idea, not a working product. Some skeleton code here and I got to try a design pattern I thought of. Although now I think Atomic Design Methodoligy might be best suited for a project like this.

I had an idea a few years back for companies to be able to have a single service to keep track of their software keys and licenses that are often difficult to manage in larger companies.

 - Sometimes an employee leaves the company, yet the company is still paying the subscription service years later without realizing.
 - The idea is to create a solution for managing software licenses where employees could easily make requests for access to tools, or software which is sometimes a mix of products depending on which team within the company, etc.
  - Software auditing could happen at any time and a tool such as this would make it very strait forward.
  - Employees can easily get approved for the tools they need by making a request to their manager.
  - Employers can easily stop paying for tools no longer needed or downsize their contracts as employees come and go.
  - Onboarding employees would be a very easy, "You're in the 'engineering group', you automatically get VisualStudio, a GitHub corporate user, etc. things that in larger companies often take weeks to fully onboard new personel with the tools  required to do the job. Even something as simple as Microsoft Word and Excel can be challenging to manage in a cost saving way.
  - Software companies themselves would love it because it would be an easy orchestration into their sales division, and could promote new tooling or promotional offers to large companies all in one go.

# Anyway

These side projects of mine don't reflect how I write production code. When it's just me I just try to have fun and learn.

Not much functionality at all just skeleton work. Most the packages I was using years ago are deprecated anyway. I'd want to switch a couple things. If anyone is out there who wants to make this a reality you have my blessing, but I promise you'd want me leading the team.
