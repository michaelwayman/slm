I had an idea a few years back for corporations to be able to have a single service to keep track of software and licenses that are difficult to manage in larger companies.
 - Sometimes an employee leaves the company, yet the company is still paying the subscription service years later without realizing.
 - My idea was to create a solution for managing software license compliance where employees could easily make requests for tools for financing, software development, graphic software, billing software, etc.
  - Software auditing could happen at any time and a tool such as this would make it very strait forward.
  - Employees can easily get approved for the tools they need by making a request to their manager.
  - Employers can easily stop paying for tools no longer needed or size down their contracts as employees come and go.
  - Onboarding employees would be a very easy, "You're in the 'engineering group', you automatically get VisualStudio, a GitHub corporate user, etc. things that in larger companies often take weeks sometimes months to fully onboard new personel with the tools actually required to do the job. Even something as simple as Microsoft Word and Excel can be challenging to manage in a cost saving way.
  - Software companies themselves would love it because it would be an easy orchestration into their sales division, and could promote new tooling or promotional offers to large companies all in one go.

# Anyway

These side projects of mine don't reflect how I write production code. When it's just me I just try to have fun and learn.

It was a lot to take on as a 1 man team, so I didn't get too far, but I loved the learning experience, and was able to try a couple different develop patterns and got to see how each played out. This is actually a good idea but I'd need a 3-4 man development team and then a marketing campaign/VC to get the ball rolling.

### Not too much functionality just skeleton work. Most the packages I was using years ago are deprecated and I'd want to switch a couple things. If anyone is out there who wants to make this a reality you have my blessing, but I promise you'd want me leading the team.
